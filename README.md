# 📖 Libft

**Libft** is every 42 student's first attempt at creating a static archive that stores a multitude of useful functions for future C programming. The porpose of this project is not only to introduce the student to **Makefile's** language and capabilities but also to start an ever-updating library that will be useful in future C projects. So as not to reinvent the wheel each time we need to allocate space, write a string or convert a **char** to an **integer**, this collection of functions serve as a great starting point for any programmer.
